# AppDynamics Operator

AppDynamics Operator simplifies the configuration and lifecycle management of the AppDynamics ClusterAgent and the AppDynamics Machine Agent on different Kubernetes distributions and OpenShift. The Operator encapsulates key operational knowledge on how to configure and upgrade the ClusterAgent and the Machine Agent. It knows, for example, which configuration changes are benign and do not require restart of the ClusterAgent, which minimizes unnecesary load on the cluster API server.

The Operator is implemented using [OperatorSDK](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-sdk) and uses Kubernetes API to maintain the desired state of the custom resources that represent the ClusterAgent and the Machine Agent.
When the Operator is deployed, it creates custom resource definitions (CRDs) for 2 custom resources:

* [clusteragent](https://github.com/Appdynamics/appdynamics-operator#clusteragent-deployment), which represents the ClusterAgent.
* [infraviz](https://github.com/Appdynamics/appdynamics-operator#the-machine-agent-deployment), which represents the Machine Agent bundled with netviz and analytics.


This level of abstraction further simplifies the management of monitoring and imstrumentation and ensures granular security policy of the ClusterAgent and the Machine Agent.



## Operator deployment
Create namespace for the operator and the ClusterAgent

* Create namespace for AppDynamics components
  * Kubernetes
   `kubectl create namespace appdynamics`
  * OpenShift
   `oc new-project appdynamics --description="AppDynamics Infrastructure"`

* Create Secret `cluster-agent-secret` with the following key
  * The "controller-key" - the access key to the AppDynamics controller.

```
kubectl -n appdynamics create secret generic cluster-agent-secret \
--from-literal=controller-key="<controller-access-key>" \
```

* Update the image reference in the Operator deployment spec (deploy/cluster-agent-operator.yaml), if necessary.

The default is "docker.io/appdynamics/cluster-agent-operator:latest".


* Deploy the Operator
```
kubectl apply -f deploy/cluster-agent-operator.yaml
```


### Images

By default "docker.io/appdynamics/cluster-agent-operator:latest" is used.

[AppDynamics images](https://access.redhat.com/containers/#/product/f5e13e601dc05eaa) are also available from [Red Hat Container Catalog](https://access.redhat.com/containers/).

To enable pulling,  create a secret in the ClusterAgent namespace. In this example, namespace **appdynamics** is used and appdynamics-operator account is linked to the secret.

```
$ oc -n appdynamics create secret docker-registry redhat-connect
--docker-server=registry.connect.redhat.com
--docker-username=REDHAT_CONNECT_USERNAME
--docker-password=REDHAT_CONNECT_PASSWORD --docker-email=unused
$ oc -n appdynamics secrets link appdynamics-operator redhat-connect
--for=pull
```


## ClusterAgent deployment

The AppDynamics Cluster Agent is a new, lightweight agent written in Golang providing APM monitoring for Kubernetes. The Cluster Agent is designed to help you understand how Kubernetes infrastructure affects your applications and business performance. With the AppDynamics Cluster Agent, you can collect metadata, metrics, and events about a Kubernetes cluster. You can query for the components in the cluster, and report metrics for those components. The Cluster Agent works across cloud platforms such as Kubernetes on AWS EKS, AKS on Azure, PKS on Pivotal and many others.
The `clusteragent` is the custom resource that the Operator works with to deploy an instance of the ClusterAgent. When a clusteragent spec is provided, the Operator will create a single replica deployment and the necessary additional resources (a configMap and a service) to support the ClusterAgent.

Here is an example of a minimalistic spec of the ClusterAgent custom resource:

```
apiVersion: appdynamics.com/v1alpha1
kind: Clusteragent
metadata:
  name: k8s-cluster-agent
  namespace: appdynamics
spec:
  appName: "<app-name>"
  controllerUrl: "<protocol>://<appdynamics-controller-host>:<port>"
  account: appdynamics-cluster-agent
  image: "<your-docker-registry>/appdynamics/cluster-agent:tag"
```

Update [the provided spec](https://github.com/Appdynamics/appdynamics-operator/blob/master/deploy/cluster-agent.yaml) with the AppDynamics account information and deploy:

```
kubectl apply -f deploy/cluster-agent.yaml
```

## The Machine Agent deployment

Appdynamics operator can be used to enable server and network visibility with AppDynamics Machine agent.
The operator works with custom resource `infraviz` to deploy the AppDynamics Machine Agent daemon set.

Here is an example of a minimalistic `infraviz` spec with the required parameters:

```
apiVersion: appdynamics.com/v1alpha1
kind: InfraViz
metadata:
  name: appd-infraviz
  namespace: appdynamics
spec:
  controllerUrl: "https://appd-controller.com"
  image: "docker.io/appdynamics/machine-agent-analytics:latest"
  account: "<your-account-name>"
  globalAccount: "<your-global-account-name"

```

 The controller URL must be in the following format:
` <protocol>://<controller-domain>:<port> `


Use the provided specs for [Kubernetes](https://github.com/Appdynamics/appdynamics-operator/blob/master/deploy/infraviz.yaml) and [OpenShift](https://github.com/Appdynamics/appdynamics-operator/blob/master/deploy/infraviz-openshift.yaml) to deploy the Machine Agent. Make sure to update the spec with the AppDynamics account information prior to deployment.

```
kubectl apply -f deploy/infraviz.yaml
```
On OpenShift:

```
oc apply -f deploy/infraviz-openshift.yaml
```

### Mixed OS Clusters
As of v 0.5.0, the operator can deploy Machine Agent daemonsets to both Linux and Windows nodes. The deployment startegy in mixed OS clusters is determined by the value of the `nodeOS` property. This property has the following values:

* linux
* windows
* all

To deploy the Machine Agent to both OSs you have several options:

1. A single Infraviz resource. You may use a single custom resource of the type Infraviz to deploy the Machine Agent across all nodes regardless of the operating system. Set the `nodeOS ` property to `all`. You also have to provide the windows image reference in the `imageWin` property of the InfraViz spec. When the `nodeOS ` property is set to `all`, the operator will create 2 daemonsets, one for Linux nodes and the other one for Windows nodes.

2. Separate Infraviz resources. You can create 2 independent custom resources of the type Infraviz, one for the Linux nodes and the other one for the Windows nodes. In the Linux spec set the value of `nodeOS ` to `linux`. In the Windows spec, set the value of the `nodeOS ` to `windows`. In the Windows spec you also have to provide the image reference in the `imageWin` property. Make sure that the custom resource names are different.
 

The choice of the strategy depends on your customization needs. The first strategy is convenient when both Linux and Windows daemonsets share all Infraviz properties (resources, ports, etc). 
If Linux and Windows daemonsets need to be customized independently, the secod strategy is more practical.

In both secanrios the placement is driven by the `nodeSelector` value. The operator will generate a nodeSelector, if not specified by the user, and set the value of `"kubernetes.io/os"` to `linux` or `windows` depending on the value of the `nodeOS` property. You can provide additional nodeSelector values as necessary using the `nodeSelector` property of the Infraviz spec.

If `nodeOS` is not set, the operator will attempt to deploy the daemonset to all available worker nodes in the cluster, regardless of the OS. If you have a mixed OS cluster, you will need to set the `nodeSelector` property to `kubernetes.io/os: linux` or a similar depending on the labels used on the cluster nodes.
The `enableMasters` directive will be honored in all cases except when `nodeOS` property is set to `windows`. 

Updates to the infraViz with different `nodeOS` values is transparent. For example, if you have an existing Infraviz instance with `nodeOS` set to "", "linux", or "windows" and you change the `nodeOS` property to 'all', the operator will automatically create the second daemonset and update the existing one if required. There is one excpetion, when going on reverse, from 2 daemonsets down to 1 daemonset. In this case you need to delete the Infraviz resource with `nodeOS` set to `all` and deploy another Infraviz instance targeted for Linux or Windows
